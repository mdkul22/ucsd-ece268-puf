## ECE 268 (Security in Hardware Embedded Systems)
This project uses code by our mentor Siam Hussain but modifies
it according to the MAC PUF that we are targetting.

#### Details
We use the PUF.v file as a main top hiearchy file.
We may either use the python jupyter notebooks in PYNQ or another top hiearchy file to function as an FSM. Most likely we will be using the python file as it will allow us to test the system on a PYNQ board.
